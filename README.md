# \$1-Algorithm-Implementation

This project goal will be to implement the $1 algorithm from the \$-family of gesture recognition algorithms. We will build up the components needed to do a  live demo and run offline recognition tests of the algorithm step by step each week, until the final deliverables are due.

## Drawing on Canvas

### Goal 
The goals of Part 1 of Project #1 are for you to do the following:
