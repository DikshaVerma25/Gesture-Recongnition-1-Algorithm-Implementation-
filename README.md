# \$1-Algorithm-Implementation

This project goal will be to implement the $1 algorithm from the \$-family of gesture recognition algorithms. We will build up the components needed to do a  live demo and run offline recognition tests of the algorithm step by step each week, until the final deliverables are due.

## Drawing on Canvas

### Goal 
The goals of Part 1 of Project #1 are for you to do the following:  
a) set up your project development environment;  
b) instantiate a blank ‘canvas’ to the screen using GUI elements;  
c) listen for mouse or touch events on the canvas and draw them as the user makes them; and  
d) allow the user to clear the canvas.

**Code Explaination:**

*A) Importing the libraries and initializing the canvas*

Line **1-3** the libraries are imported.<br>

*B) Creating canvas*

Line **6-7** Instance of Tk class is created which is stored in the variable root. And renaming the the canvas as Group 21. <br>
